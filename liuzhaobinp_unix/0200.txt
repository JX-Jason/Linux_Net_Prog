Hello,everyone:
My name is Wang Zhongjie, a student of Computer Science & Technology in Dalian Maritime University.
I am fond of embedded system. When i watched the movie "WALL-E", it's so great if i can make a so cute robot like WALL-E!
So i try to make such a robot step by step:first, i learned how to use the 3D printer to build the body of WALL-E. Second,how to make the robot smarter is a diffcult problem for me: i put a microcontrollerchip into his body to control some step motors,server motors and normal motors.
It is interesting to do that,finally,someone told me that he should run with an operating system rather than an bare machine.
So i want to learn how to use the Linux to control him.
